# Mark Up Game
 It's a game built on second chances and high school vibes. We lost the source code, but we have the game itself and this should be up here just for the vibes. Presenting to you --> MarkUp, a Money Heist (not the Netflix series) themed game.

## Story
Mindbox India hosted a game design competition centered around the theme of "Money." Intrigued by the challenge, our group decided to partake, despite our limited background in game development. As mere high school students, our knowledge in programming extended to basic Java and SQL skills, a remnant of our experiences back in 2017. In light of our novice status, we opted for GameMaker Studio (https://gamemaker.io/en), a user-friendly UI-based game development tool.

Choosing GameMaker Studio was our initial step towards bridging the knowledge gap. As newcomers to the world of game design, we embarked on the ambitious task of building and designing game levels. Although we made decent progress, we soon faced a daunting realization - a single evening was all that remained to complete our entire game. Until that point, we had meticulously worked within the confines of our school's computer lab. However, necessity forced us to transfer our project to a laptop and collaborate at one of our homes. As the hours ticked away, we teetered on the brink of despair. To our surprise and relief, Chirag emerged the following day with a fully realized game.

The competition officially commenced, and the judges began their evaluations. The outcome of the first round dealt us a heavy blow - rejection. We were disheartened but not defeated. We regrouped, making minor adjustments, and approached the judges with a humble request for a second chance. Our subsequent efforts were focused on addressing minor bugs, nothing too extravagant. To our astonishment, the judges granted our plea, and we ultimately secured the position of runner-up.

Now, you might wonder why we've chosen this platform to share our story rather than crafting a detailed blog post. The reason is twofold. Firstly, as college students, we relished the sense of accomplishment derived from becoming runner-ups, despite our complete lack of prior game development experience. Secondly, we aspire to inspire others to grasp their second opportunities and revel in unexpected victories. Sometimes, it's about the journey, the personal growth, and the sheer elation of surpassing one's own expectations.
