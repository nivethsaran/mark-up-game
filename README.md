# Mark Up Game
 It's a game built on second chances and high school vibes. We lost the source code, but we have the game itself and this should be up here just for the vibes. Presenting to you --> MarkUp, a Money Heist (not the Netflix series) themed game.

## Story
Mindbox India and [Design Championship](https://designchampionship.in/home) in collaboration hosted a [game design] competition called [Game Jam Titans](https://www.facebook.com/GameJamTitans) centered around the theme of "Money." Intrigued by the challenge, we formed a small group of 4 and decided to participate, despite our limited background in game development. As mere high school students, our knowledge in programming extended to basic Java and SQL skills, a remnant of our experiences back in 2016. In light of our novice status, we opted for GameMaker Studio (https://gamemaker.io/en), a user-friendly UI-based game development tool.

Choosing GameMaker Studio was our initial step towards bridging the knowledge gap. As newcomers to the world of game design, we embarked on the ambitious task of building and designing game levels. Although we made decent progress, we soon faced a daunting realization - a single evening was all that remained to complete our entire game. Until that point, we had meticulously worked within the confines of our school's computer lab. However, necessity forced us to transfer our project to a laptop and collaborate at one of our homes. As the hours ticked away, we were unsure if we would be able to complete the game at all. To our surprise and relief, Chirag emerged the following day with a fully realized game.

The competition officially commenced, and the judges began their evaluations. The outcome of the first round dealt us a heavy blow - rejection. We were disheartened but not defeated. We regrouped, making minor adjustments, and approached the judges with a humble request for a second chance. Our subsequent efforts were focused on addressing minor bugs, nothing too extravagant. To our astonishment, the judges granted our plea, and we ultimately secured the position of runner-up.

Now, you might be wondering why I've shared this story here, without turning it into a lengthy blog post. Well, the truth is, we felt an incredible sense of achievement as high school students, becoming runner-ups despite having zero experience in game development. But the bigger reason for sharing it is the hope that it might inspire someone else to seize their second chances and savor the moments of unexpected success. Sometimes, it's about the journey, the growth, and the sheer joy of defying expectations.
