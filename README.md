# Mark Up Game
 It's a game built on second chances and high school vibes. We lost the source code, but we have the game itself and this should be up here just for the vibes. Presenting to you --> MarkUp, a Money Heist (not the Netflix series) themed game.

## Story
Mindbox India conducted a game design competition, the theme being Money. We decided to participate, but we knew nothing about the game development. All we knew as high school students way back in 2017, was some basic Java and SQL Programming. So, we decided to go with a UI Based Game Development tool. 

We chose GameMaker Studio(https://gamemaker.io/en). It has almost everything we needed to develop, but us being entirely new to game design, we had to start somewhere. We tried building and designing levels and did a decent job. But soon, we realized that we had just one more evening to complete the entire game that we had planned. Until now we had done everything in our computer lab. So we transferred it to a laptop and started working on it back at home together, the 4 of us. We almost lost hope as to what we could end up building, but Chirag surprised us the next day with a completed game. 

Now, the competition started and the judges started judging. We got rejected in the first round. We were completely distraught, but we sat together made some minor changes, and asked the judges if we could try again. We didn't do much again, just a few minor bug fixes. The judges agreed and eventually, we ended up being the runner-ups. 

Now, you might be wondering why I've shared this story here, without turning it into a lengthy blog post. Well, the truth is, we felt an incredible sense of achievement as high school students, becoming runner-ups despite having zero experience in game development. But the bigger reason for sharing it is the hope that it might inspire someone else to seize their second chances and savor the moments of unexpected success. Sometimes, it's about the journey, the growth, and the sheer joy of defying expectations.
